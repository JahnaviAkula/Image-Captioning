# Image Captioning

## Project Description

The Image Captioning project is designed to generate textual descriptions for images automatically. It utilizes the Flicker8k dataset and the VGG16 model to train a deep learning model capable of generating captions for given images.

The main goals of this project are:
- To explore the field of computer vision and natural language processing.
- To understand the process of training an image captioning model.
- To develop a practical application that can generate meaningful captions for images.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/Ineshrao/Image-Captioning.git
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage Guide

To use the Image Captioning project, follow these steps:

1. Prepare the dataset:
   - Download the Flicker8k dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/adityajn105/flickr8k).
   - Extract the downloaded dataset.

2. Preprocess the dataset:
   - Run the preprocessing script to preprocess the images and captions.

3. Train the model:
   - Open the provided Jupyter Notebook file (`image_captioning.ipynb`).
   - Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the image captioning model using the preprocessed dataset.

4. Generate captions for new images:
   - After training the model, load the trained model in the notebook.
   - Use the model to generate captions for new images.

## Configuration

No additional configuration is required for this project.
